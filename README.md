* View all departments
* View all roles

* Update an employee role
* Remove a role

When the user chooses to view all departments, they are presented with a formatted table showing department names and department IDs. When the user chooses to view all roles, they are presented with the job title, role ID, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role.

When the user chooses to view all employees, they are presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee IDs, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to.
